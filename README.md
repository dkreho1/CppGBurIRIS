# GBur-IRIS
An algorithm for computing collision-free convex volumes of configuration space.

## Overview
This repository contains the C++ implementation of the GBur-IRIS algorithm. The algorithm was originally written in Python, which can be found in the [PyGBurIRIS](https://github.com/dzenankreho/PyGBurIRIS) repository.
